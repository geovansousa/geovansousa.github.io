It is already published my new paper, in collaboration with Geissy Lima-Araújo, Dráulio Araújo and Bernardete Sousa, where we investigated the role of trait mindfulness on stress and affect measures in a sample of university students without previous experience with meditation. In addition, we also assessed the effects of a brief (3 days, 30 minutes a day) mindfulness intervention compared to an active control (colouring pictures).

Our main results are:
* Higher trait mindfulness level buffered anxiety and stress measures
* A decrease in perceived stress and state anxiety, and an increase in state mindfulness, were found only for the mindfulness group
* Negative affect and cortisol decreased for both mindfulness and control groups
* Anxiety response to brief mindfulness intervention depends on trait mindfulness
