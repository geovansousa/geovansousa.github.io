It is already published my new paper, in collaboration with Geissy Lima-Araújo, Dráulio Araújo and Bernardete Sousa, where we evaluated the role of trait mindfulness in measures of stress and affect in a non-meditators sample of university students, as well as assessed the effects of a brief (3 days, 30 minutes a day) mindfulness intervention compared to an active control (coloring pictures).

Our main results are:
* Higher trait mindfulness level buffers anxiety and stress measures
* A decrease in perceived stress and anxiety state, and an increase in state mindfulness, are found only for mindfulness group
* Negative affect and cortisol decreased for both mindfulness and control groups
* Anxiety response to brief mindfulness intervention depends of mindfulness trait
