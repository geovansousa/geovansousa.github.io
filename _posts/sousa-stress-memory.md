Published on *Behavioural Brain Research*, this review is a collaboration with Nicole Galvão-Coelho, Flávio Barbosa, and Hector Vargas, where we gathered animal and 
human studies to provide an outline of the physiological responses to stress, the main memory systems - as proposed by the *explicit-implict* model - and its 
neural substrates, and the effects of acute/chronic stress in each memory system. 

Finally, we also show how memory dysfunctions and stress correlates with major depression, and illustrate how memory can be a useful tool for Psychiatry.
