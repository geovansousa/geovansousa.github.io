In this paper authored by A.C.M. Galv√£o *et al.*, we show contrasts in biomarkers between first-episode depressive patients and patients with resistant depression. 
The evaluated biomarkers are serum and salivary (awakening response) cortisol, C-reactive protein, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor. 
Sleep quality and depressive symptoms were also assessed through self-report.
