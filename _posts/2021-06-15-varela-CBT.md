I recently co-authored a paper by Y.M. Varela *et al.* on CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) and depression, where we show that a 16-week group CBT (gCBT) decreased depressive and anxiety symptoms while improved sleep quality in a young-adult participants with mild depression.
As expected this is more pronounced in participants who achieved remission after treatment.

We also showed that, after gCBT, improvements in sleep quality and salivary cortisol reached values similar to the healthy control participants.
